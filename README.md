FEATURES AND NAVIGATION THROUGH WEBSITE

This project primarily consists of 3 features:
1.	Sign In: This feature is for the existing users where they sign-in using their existing email-id and password. 
2.	Register: This feature if for the new users and first-time visitors. They need to register themselves using their name, email-id and password to be able to use the tool conveniently.
3.	Detect and Sign out: This is the main focussed feature of the website. It allows you to enter the URL of any image and returns the image after detecting the faces in it. Image detection is significant due to the presence of a blue box around the detected faces. This is achieved by the use of Clarifai API and related functions.
